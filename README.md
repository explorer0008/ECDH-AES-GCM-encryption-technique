# ECDH-AES-GCM-encryption-technique
This is an encyrption technique which is a hybrid of AES GCM and ECDH. ECDH Instantly creates a 256-bit shared secret without ever sending it. Even if the encrypted file is intercepted, the attacker learns nothing. AES-256-GCM is a  Military-grade authenticated encryption
